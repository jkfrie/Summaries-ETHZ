\section{IoT Security} 
Conventional Security mechanisms don't work well because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constrained capabilities and resources
    \item Diverse communication technologies
\end{itemize}{}

\paragraph{Information Leakage: }Event-driven communication of the devices leads to the possibility to infer information about what is going on (e.g. user is walking from one point to other)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Existential Leakage: Occurs when the transmission of a single message implies a real-world event (e.g. a car enters a parking spot and this is reported by an Occupancy sensor)\\
    Can not be fully eliminated.
    \item Statistical Leakage: Occurs when a deviation from normal implies a real-world event. (e.g a company event leads to more activity on the parking lot.)\\
    can be eliminated.
\end{enumerate}{}

\paragraph{Other Information Leakage despite encryption:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item VoIP Phonemes analysis of encrypted transmission data.
    \item D
\end{itemize}{}
